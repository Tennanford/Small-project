## Hawk-dove game:
### the first(1.0) version: yingge1 +fun1+Stacked bar chart
A most basic hawk-dove game model       Stacked bar charts are used to plot hawk-pigeon ratios in different algebras
### the second(1.1) version: yingge2+papapa2+fun2+count2 
Involves randomly setting the probability of selection strategies, gene recombination, gene mutation.       
The function of count2 is to calculate and summarize the proportion of 1 and 0 of each individual in the population obtained by the main program (the horizontal coordinate is the proportion of 1, and the vertical coordinate is the number of individuals in this proportion).
